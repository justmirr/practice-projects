# practice-projects

This repository is a collection of small projects, experiments, and hands-on tasks as I explore different tools, technologies, and programming skills.

## About

This repo acts as my personal playground where I:

- Practice new tools and languages  
- Build mini-projects or replicate concepts  
- Explore libraries, APIs, and platforms  
- Document learnings through practical code  

Youâ€™ll find content related to:

1. **Backend** (FastAPI, Node.js, etc.)  
2. **Frontend** (React, Tailwind, etc.)  
3. **DevOps tools** (Docker, Terraform, Ansible, etc.)  
4. **Programming languages** (Go, Python, etc.)  
5. **Databases, APIs, ML**, and more

Each folder is self-contained, focusing on one topic, tool, or concept at a time.
